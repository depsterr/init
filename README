    |--libushi    : library loaded by init and services
    |--services   : directory for the all the services
    \--runlevels  : runlevel directories with symlinks to enabled services
      |-sysinit   : services that start the system, do not add services
      |                 here unless you know what you're doing.
      |-boot      : services that start after the system is ready, this is 
      |                 the runlevel most user scripts will go in. these
      |                 services are also stopped before powering down.
      |-powerdown : services that start before the system either powers
      |                 off or reboots. good place for user scripts.
      |-poweroff  : services that start as the system is powering off,
      |                 do not add services here unless you know what
      |                 you are doing.
      \-reboot    : services that start as the system is rebooting, do
                        not add services here unless you know what you
                        are doing.
